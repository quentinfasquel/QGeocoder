QGeocoder is similar to CLGeocoder, it provides services of forward- and reverse-geocoding, with the delegation pattern instead of completion blocks.
The services use the Google Geocoding API : http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/#GeocodingRequests

Since CLGeocoder is only available on iOS 5.0 and later, developers who look for more compatibility will be interested in QGeocoder.
Plus, it does support the CLGeocoder API.

* Compile with CLGeocoder API support 
The 'QGEOCODER_IPHONE_5_0_API_WRAPPER' macro enable the 'usesCoreLocationGeocoder' property which make QGeocoder use CLGeocoder.
This will only work on iOS 5.0 and later so you are responsible for it. When developing for iOS 5.x and EARLIER, this property should be related to '[[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion]'.
