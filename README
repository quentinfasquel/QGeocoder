QGeocoder is similar to CLGeocoder, it provides services of forward- and reverse-geocoding, with the delegation pattern instead of completion blocks.
The services use the Google Geocoding API : http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/#GeocodingRequests

Since CLGeocoder is only available on iOS 5.0 and later, developers who look for more compatibility will be interested in QGeocoder.
Plus, google geocoding is much better.
